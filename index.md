# Technical Portfolio by Daniel Evans

Welcome to my portfolio! I am currently pursuing an undergraduate degree in Computer Systems at the Ira A. Fulton School of Engineering and earning a master’s degree in Computer Science. I will apply the skills I have acquired from my IT, process engineering, and software engineering experiences to my software development career.

## Personal Projects
[My GitHub](https://github.com/danieljevans)

### To-Do List

- Developed Java application that stores reminder objects that can be sorted by various categories. 
- Performed as team lead, developed scrum goals, and used a simple lifecycle that involved design (using MVC architecture), implementation, and integration of several individually developed modules.

### Git Up and Move

- Developed IOS application that uses Google Maps API to display local restaurants. 
- Once a restaurant is selected from the list, the user is presented with a cardinal direction to walk. 
- Once the local is reached, the user is able to take a picture and saves the visit to be viewed later.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/danieljevans/danieljevans.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
