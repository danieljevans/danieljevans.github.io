# Technical Portfolio by Daniel Evans

Welcome to my portfolio! I am currently pursuing an undergraduate degree in Computer Systems at the Ira A. Fulton School of Engineering and earning a master’s degree in Computer Science. I will apply the skills I have acquired from my IT, process engineering, and software engineering experiences to my software development career.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/danieljevans/danieljevans.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
